          <p>
            We're on a mission to revolutionize the energy drink industry with
            clean, sustainable energy that actually works.

            <h2>> Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Re-Fresh was born from a simple frustration: why do energy
              drinks have to be loaded with sugar, artificial ingredients, and
              leave you crashing by 3PM? We set out to create something
              different—a clean energy drink that powers your day without the
              compromise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Founded in Huddersfield, UK, we're a team of health-conscious
              creators, athletes, and professionals who believe energy should
              enhance your performance, not derail it. Every can of Re-Fresh is
              crafted with precision, using only the highest quality ingredients
              to deliver sustained focus and energy.

              at your best—whether that's in the office, gym, or wherever your
